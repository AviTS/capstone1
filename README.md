My web app allows a user to follow stocks through their own stock watchlists. Once you create a watchlist, you will be able to add stocks to it by entering the stock symbol. Once added to a watchlist, you can click on the stock to display stock information. 

First, the user will have to signup. Then, the user can create a watchlist and then add whatever stock they want to that watchlist. A user can also remove a stock from a watchlist.

API:
